#This is the Third Level (Level-3) of this project Task.

TASK -1
Restaurant Reviews Objective
Analyze the text reviews to identify the most common positive and negative keywords &Calculate the average length of reviews and explore if there is a relationship between review length and rating.

IMPLEMENTATION
We will preprocess the text reviews by removing punctuation & we will extract the most frequently occurring positive and negative keywords from the reviews. The average length of reviews will be calculated and plotted against ratings to analyze if longer reviews are associated with higher or lower ratings, this will help in understanding customer sentiment and its impact on restaurant ratings.

TASK -2
Vote Analysis Objective:
Identify the restaurants with the highest and lowest number of votes & analyze if there is a correlation between the number of votes and the rating of a restaurant.

IMPLEMENTATION
We will sort the dataset to find the restaurants with the highest and lowest number of votes & a scatter plot will be created to visualize the relationship between the number of votes and the restaurant rating.
Statistical correlation methods will be used to measure the strength of the relationship between votes and ratings. If a strong correlation exists, it will indicate that highly-rated restaurants tend to receive more votes. This analysis will provide insights into customer engagement with restaurant ratings.

TASK -3
Price Range vs. Online Delivery and Table Booking Objective:
Analyze if there is a relationship between the price range and the availability of online delivery and table booking & determine if higher-priced restaurants are more likely to offer these services.

IMPLEMENTATION
We will group restaurants by price range and calculate the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery and table booking in each category. A bar chart will be created to visually compare the availability of these services across different price ranges to determine if the differences in service availability across price ranges are statistically significant. This analysis will help understand whether premium restaurants are more inclined to provide online delivery and table booking services.
