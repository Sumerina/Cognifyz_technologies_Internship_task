#This is the Second Level (Level-2) of this project Task.

TASK -1
Restaurant Ratings Objective:
Analyze the distribution of aggregate ratings and determine the most common rating range. Also calculate the average number of votes received by restaurants.

IMPLEMENTATION -
We will first analyze the distribution of aggregate ratings by grouping them into ranges & a bar chart will be created to visualize the most common rating range. We will compute the average number of votes received by restaurants to understand how engaged customers are with restaurant reviews. This analysis will help identify the general quality of restaurants and customer engagement trends.

TASK -2
Cuisine Combination objective:
Identify the most common combinations of cuisines in the dataset & Determine if certain cuisine combinations tend to have higher ratings.

IMPLEMENTATION - 
We will extract unique cuisine combinations from the dataset and count their occurrences to determine the most common ones. The average rating for each cuisine combination will be calculated to check if certain combinations receive consistently higher ratings. This analysis will help identify popular and high-rated cuisine pairings

TASK -3
Geographic Analysis Objective
Plot the locations of restaurants on a map using longitude and latitude coordinates, & Identify any patterns or clusters of restaurants in specific areas.

IMPLEMENTATION-
We will extract longitude and latitude information from the dataset to plot restaurant locations on a geographic map &using visualization tools such as Folium, Seaborn, or Matplotlib, we will generate a heatmap to highlight restaurant distribution. Clustering algorithms like DBSCAN may be used to detect high-density restaurant zones. This analysis will help understand the spatial distribution of restaurants and identify popular dining areas.

TASK -4
Restaurant Chains Objective
Identify if there are any restaurant chains present in the dataset & analyze the ratings and popularity of different restaurant chains.

IMPLEMENTATION-
We will group restaurants by name to identify chains and count the number of outlets per chain. The popularity of restaurant chains will be assessed based on the number of outlets and the average rating of each chain. A comparison between independent restaurants and chain restaurants will be conducted to analyze differences in ratings and customer preferences that will provide insights into the dominance of restaurant chains and their reputation compared to standalone eateries.
